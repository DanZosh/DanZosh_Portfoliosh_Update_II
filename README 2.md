The Repository For Danny Maier's Portolio

This is the repository for Danny Maier's portfolio. The portfolio consists of an HTML and associated asset file with CSS and images used in the HTML. The design closely resembles the example provided by a gif. The works shown include my first homework project and placeholder projects from my current career path. 



GIVEN a sample of Danny's previous work
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
